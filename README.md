Filename = userChrome.css

This is a .css file to increase the row height in the thunderbird message pane.

In linux, Thunderbird tends to leave too little space above and below each line making it hard to differentiate between messages, especially on large monitors.

This css tweak solves the problem without using a plugin.

This file lives in /home/user/.thunderbird/name.default/chrome/
