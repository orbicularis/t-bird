Filename = userChrome.css

This is a .css file to increase the row height in the thunderbird message pane.

In linux, Thunderbird tends to leave too little space above and below each line making it hard to differentiate between messages, especially on large monitors.

This css tweak solves the problem without using a plugin.

The font referenced is Overpass, but any font family will do.  3px space top and bottom with 12pt font is nice on a 4K monitor.  Adjust less or more to taste.

This file lives in /home/user/.thunderbird/name.default/chrome/
